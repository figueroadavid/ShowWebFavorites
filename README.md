Powershell graphical bookmark manager

This will be a GUI based web book mark manager written in powershell.  The goal of this is **not** to interact directly with the browsers and managed their individual favorites - the goal is to have a single UI for bookmarks that will launch the appropriate browser for a given bookmark (as the user chooses).
